if your github desktop does not work:
1. if using Netbeans: copy the everything in folder [src] to replace the [src] folder 
2. if using intellij, copy everything in the folder [src\main\java] to the [src] folder in your intellij project.
go to [control] folder, right click on the file "TestView.java" and run.
